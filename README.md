🔥 AI Fire Monitoring System

An AI-powered IoT-based fire detection and monitoring system that provides real-time alerts, data analytics, and automated reporting to improve fire safety and emergency response efficiency.

🚀 Overview

The AI Fire Monitoring System integrates IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect heat, gas, smoke, humidity, air quality  in real time. Once a potential fire is identified, the system instantly sends alerts to relevant authorities such as BOMBA JBPM officers, enabling faster response and reducing the risk of major damage.

🧠 Key Features

🔍 AI Detection: Uses computer vision and sensor data for accurate fire identification

🌐 IoT Integration: Connects multiple monitoring devices through a centralized network

📊 Real-Time Dashboard: Displays live status, fire locations, and historical data

📱 Automated Alerts: Sends notifications via mobile and web platforms

🧾 Reporting Module: Generates analytical reports for post-incident review

☁️ Cloud Storage: Stores sensor data and event logs securely
